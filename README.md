📌 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Credit Card Fraud Risk Analysis Dashboard, built using Power BI. The aim is to analyze, detect, and visualize patterns of fraudulent transactions from a dataset to help financial institutions monitor, detect, and prevent credit card fraud effectively.

The dashboard provides deep insights into fraudulent vs non-fraudulent transaction trends, user behavior patterns, transaction types, amounts, and other key performance indicators (KPIs) critical for fraud detection and risk analysis.



🧠 Objective

The core objective of this project is to:

- Identify potential fraudulent transactions
- Analyze risk factors contributing to credit card fraud
- Create a visual, interactive, and easy-to-understand dashboard for stakeholders
- Enable data-driven decision-making for fraud mitigation
